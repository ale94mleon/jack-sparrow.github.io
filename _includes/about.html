                <p><font size="4px"> My name is Pablo Ricardo Arantes, and I am a research scientist at the University of California Riverside, working in the field of biophysics (<a href="https://palermolab.com/people/">Palermo Lab</a>). I hold extensive expertise in computational biophysics and knowledge in state‐ of‐the‐art computational methods that have been proven instrumental in delving deep into biological function. During my PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology, I worked with different glycoproteins and glycoconjugates (Arantes et al., 2014), such as Antithrombin (Arantes et al., 2017) and PglB (Pedebos et al., 2015). Moreover, I worked with the ABC transporter PglK from Campylobacter jejuni (Arantes et al., 2020). This protein works as a flippase, translocating a glycolipid across the bacterial periplasmic membrane. Also during my PhD, I worked in a project that developed a new parameter set for MD simulations of chalcones and flavonoids (Arantes et al., 2019) main scaffolds under GROMOS force field. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4px"> My research at the University of California focuses on molecular simulations of emerging genome editing technologies based on the CRISPR‐Cas9 system that received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2020. With the lingering pandemic and the ever‐so‐increasing numbers of COVID‐19‐positive cases, rapid yet reliable testing of patients is the need of the hour. A novel genome editing tool, viz. CRISPR‐ Cas12a, is now being developed as an extraordinarily rapid diagnostic tool, especially for the screening of SARS‐CoV‐2 (Broughton et al, 2020). My research is at the forefront of understanding the molecular basis of the COVID‐19 pandemic, as I have recently highlighted with a recent publication in a prestigious journal of the American Chemical Society (Arantes P. R. et al., ACS Cent. Sci. 2020), reporting the critical role of molecular simulations for the development of a potent vaccine against the deadly virus. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4px"> To help the understanding of this detection technology, I have also recently published the first computational study on the detection mechanism (Saha A., Arantes P. R. et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2020). With the aid of Anton2, one of the fastest supercomputers in the world, located in Pittsburgh, we are now aiming at understanding the DNA cleavage mechanism, pivotal in expediting the process of diagnosis by Cas12a. Importantly, to pursue this research, I am part of a prestigious research grant in the US funded by Covid‐19 High‐Performance Computing Consortium (Grant No. MCB200150) and I have also received funding from Microsoft Azure. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4px"> Lastly, in 2021 I have worked on the first user‐friendly front‐end for running molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the OpenMM toolkit on the Google Colab framework (<a href="https://pablo-arantes.github.io/making-it-rain/">Making it rain</a>). An affordable (cost‐free) strategy for performing molecular dynamics simulations using cloud computing resources. It involves shareable, ready‐to‐use, customizable Jupyter notebooks that guide the end‐user in running their calculations using Google Colab services. The user is only required to provide minimal input files, such as an initial biomolecular tridimensional structure (a PDB file), and the following MD simulation tasks are facilitated from thereon. Usual simulation analyses were also implemented in an automated fashion. Thereby, all the protocols can be customized for other specific cases as protein‐protein, protein‐ligand simulations. </font></p>
